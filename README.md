# TFM_Code
 All code used to generate the results of my Master's Thesis "Prediction of the Topological Position of a Neuron in a Complex Network from its Dynamical Behavior"

 How to replicate my results:
 1. Generate the networks and initial conditions with "network_generator.py", or use the ones I already give you in the folders "networks" and "IVs", respectively.
 2. Generate the simulation data with "simulator.py".
 3. Generate the peaks and valleys dataframes with "peaks_valleys.py".
 4. Generate the "neuron_df.csv" dataframe, which contains information of each simulated neuron, with "neuron_df_generator.py".
 5. Generate the desired figures with the Jupyter Notebook "all_figures.ipynb".
